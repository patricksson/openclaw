# Morning Routine

Run the full daily marketing automation check and content production. Do NOT ask for permission on any step. Execute everything and report results at the end.

## Step 0: Recap of Last Session

Read `/home/marketingpatpat/openclaw/social-posts/session-log.md` and find the most recent entry. Print a brief recap.

## Step 1: Check All Triggers

Use the RemoteTrigger tool (load via ToolSearch first) to check all triggers:

- **Content Machine** (trig_01VCuzhEoftowx3adqtibsP5) — Daily 14:00 UTC
- **Medium Writer** (trig_017H6LMFdyyefNV1yRZSAZNE) — Daily 08:00 UTC
- **Blog Writer** (trig_011HGMzRh9h2WENFjK5SGNfh) — Mon/Wed/Fri 10:00 UTC

For each trigger:
1. GET the trigger and check `enabled` status
2. If `enabled: false`, re-enable it immediately
3. If a trigger was supposed to fire and there's no evidence it ran (check git log), flag it

## Step 2: Check Overnight Content

Run `git log --since="yesterday" --oneline` to see what was committed overnight.

## Step 3: Check X Account Status

Check if the X account (@patrickssons) is reinstated:
```
curl -s "https://api.fxtwitter.com/patrickssons"
```
If it returns user data, the account is back. If 404, still suspended.

**IF X IS SUSPENDED:** Skip all X-related steps (tweets, replies, viral shot). Focus on TikTok, LinkedIn, Medium, Dev.to, blog.

**IF X IS BACK:** Run the X posting flow via the Telegram approval gate. See `references/x-posting-flow.md` for full procedure. /morning volume: 1 original post + 3 reply drafts. Drafts go to Telegram, Pat taps ✅/❌, only approved drafts hit the X API. NEVER use Playwright to post on X.

## Step 3b: Trigger Reddit AI Image Pipeline (n8n)

Fire the `Reddit AI Image Pipeline` workflow via webhook. No API key needed.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://n8n-zwxfn09hqi8751v1plu6rjvt.136.112.252.235.sslip.io/webhook/reddit-image-pipeline"
```

Expect `{"message":"Workflow was started"}`. Do NOT wait for completion (image gen takes minutes). If the response is not 2xx, log and continue.

## Step 4: Generate TikTok Carousels (2-3 per session)

**USE LARRY-BRAIN FRAMEWORK** from /home/marketingpatpat/.openclaw/workspace/skills/larry-marketing/references/slide-structure.md

**Check TikTok trending hashtags first:**
Visit https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/hashtag/pc/en via Playwright (read-only) to get trending hashtags.

**Hook selection — Tier 1 (Person + Conflict) performs best:**
- Family hooks get highest views (Mum: 806, Dad: 801, Boss: 652)
- Unused characters: therapist, stranger on plane, personal trainer, hairdresser, neighbour
- Each carousel uses a different conflict character

**For each carousel:**
1. Write a new hook using larry-brain Tier 1 formula
2. Title must be clickbait POV style: "POV: Your dad finds out", "POV: Your mum checks your bank"
3. Generate 6 FACELESS images using Gemini API:
   - Key: read from $GEMINI_API_KEY env var (never hardcode)
   - Model: gemini-3-pro-image-preview
   - ALL images must be faceless (shot from behind, hands only, over shoulder, overhead flat lay)
   - Wrap every prompt with: "Shot on iPhone 15 Pro, candid unedited lifestyle photo, dim natural lighting, vertical 9:16 portrait orientation, deep cinematic shadows, moody atmosphere, no text in the image."
   - Dark moody aesthetic, warm/purple lighting, gold jewelry details — matching existing TikTok videos
4. Burn text overlays using burn_text.py at /home/marketingpatpat/openclaw-full/tiktok-marketing/generated/2026-04-08/burn_text.py
5. Upload slides to Postiz and create TikTok post with content_posting_method:"UPLOAD"
6. Caption: max 5 hashtags. Include #shadowagency #aiagent #fyp + 2 relevant trending ones

Postiz credentials:
- Token: read from $POSTIZ_API_KEY env var (never hardcode)
- TikTok integration: cmmzd0apq03pmp30yh70b3uti

## Step 5: Check TikTok Stats

Run yt-dlp to pull @realnataliana profile stats:
```
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --dump-json "https://www.tiktok.com/@realnataliana"
```
Report: total videos, total views, total likes, per-video performance sorted by views.

## Step 6: Post LinkedIn Content

Post 1 LinkedIn update via Postiz API:
- 1000-1500 chars
- No links in body
- Bridge style: technical AI agent insight in plain language
- LinkedIn integration: cmnmbgu9r04w4so0ygvvi0ere

## Step 7: Post Dev.to Article (if not posted in last 3 days)

Check existing Dev.to articles first:
```
curl -s 'https://dev.to/api/articles/me?per_page=50' -H 'api-key: KRQCYHfgWYgSHLZCBRQ96McQ'
```
If last article is older than 3 days, write and publish a new one. Include canonical_url pointing to the matching automatyn.co blog post for backlinks.

## Step 8: Check Medium

Check if any Medium drafts need publishing. Use Playwright to check https://medium.com/me/stories/drafts (read-only check). If drafts exist and 2/day limit has reset, publish via Playwright.

Always include a hero image from blog/images/ when publishing to Medium.

## Step 9: Report

```
MORNING REPORT — [DATE]
========================
X STATUS: [suspended/reinstated]
TRIGGERS: [status of all 3]
TIKTOK: [X videos, Y views, Z likes]
  New carousels: [which hooks pushed to inbox]
  Top performer: [video title + views]
LINKEDIN: [posted/skipped]
DEV.TO: [posted/skipped]
MEDIUM: [published/draft waiting/skipped]
BLOG: [any scheduled publishes today]
```

## Step 10: Write Session Log

Append to `/home/marketingpatpat/openclaw/social-posts/session-log.md`:
```
### /morning — [DATE] [TIME UTC]
- X status: [suspended/reinstated]
- Triggers: [status]
- TikTok: [carousels generated, stats]
- LinkedIn: [posted/skipped]
- Dev.to: [posted/skipped]
- Medium: [published/skipped]
```
Then `git add social-posts/ && git commit -m "log: /morning session" && git push origin main`

## Content Rules (MUST follow everywhere)
- NEVER use em dashes or hyphens between clauses
- NEVER use: leverage, unlock, seamless, game-changer, revolutionary, cutting-edge, streamline, empower, synergy, optimize, disrupt
- No fake prices. Real prices: $400 / $800 / $1500 one-time + $150/mo support
- NEVER use Playwright to post/reply/like on X, Reddit, LinkedIn, or any platform with an API
- Sound human and professional, not AI-generated
