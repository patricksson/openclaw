        <h2>The Problem Every ${ind.name} Faces</h2>

        <p>${ind.pain}</p>

        <p>${ind.metric}</p>

        <p>A WhatsApp chatbot solves this by answering customer messages instantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Not a basic auto-reply that says "we will get back to you." An AI-powered bot that actually handles the conversation.</p>

        <h2>What a Real Conversation Looks Like</h2>

        <p>Here is an actual example of how a WhatsApp bot handles a typical ${ind.service} enquiry:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Customer:</strong> ${ind.example_q}<br><br>
            <strong>Bot:</strong> ${ind.example_a}
        </blockquote>

        <p>The customer got an instant, specific answer. No waiting. No phone tag. No "let me check and get back to you." The bot knew your services, your prices, and your availability because you told it once when you set it up.</p>

        <h2>What a ${ind.name} WhatsApp Bot Handles</h2>

        <p>Here is what changes when you add a WhatsApp chatbot to your ${ind.service} business:</p>

        <p>For most ${ind.plural.toLowerCase()}, the free tier is enough to start. You get 50 conversations per month, which covers most small ${ind.service} businesses. If you grow past that, upgrading is one click.</p>

        <h2>How to Set It Up (Under 10 Minutes)</h2>

        <p>Setting up a WhatsApp chatbot for your ${ind.service} business does not require coding or technical skills. Here is the process with Automatyn:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sign up and fill in your business details (name, services, prices, hours, location, policies)</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The AI creates your bot personality and knowledge base automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scan a QR code with your WhatsApp Business app to connect</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your bot is live. Test it by sending a message to your own number</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That is it. No flow building. No decision trees. No drag-and-drop editor. The AI understands natural language, so customers just type what they want like they would to a real person.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions from ${ind.plural}</h2>

        <p><strong>What if a customer asks something the bot does not know?</strong></p>
        <p>The bot tells the customer that a team member will follow up and sends you a notification. The customer gets a helpful response instead of a wrong one. This usually happens for 10 to 20 percent of messages.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I customize what the bot says?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes. You control the tone, the information, and the boundaries. If you do not want the bot discussing competitor pricing or making promises about timelines, you set that in the business rules. The bot stays within whatever limits you define.</p>

        <p><strong>Will customers know it is a bot?</strong></p>
        <p>The bot identifies itself as an AI assistant at the start of the conversation. Transparency builds trust. Most customers do not mind talking to a bot as long as it gives them useful answers quickly.</p>

        <p><strong>What happens if WhatsApp changes their rules?</strong></p>
        <p>WhatsApp allows business-specific chatbots (FAQ, booking, customer support). What they restrict is general-purpose AI bots that are not tied to a real business. As a ${ind.slug.replace(/-/g, ' ')} using a bot for your actual ${ind.service} business, you are within their guidelines.</p>

              // Pick 3 random related industries (not self)
              const others = industries.filter(i => i.slug !== ind.slug);
              const picked = [];
              const indices = [Math.floor(others.length * 0.2), Math.floor(others.length * 0.5), Math.floor(others.length * 0.8)];
              for (const idx of indices) picked.push(others[idx]);
              return picked.map(o => `<li><a href="whatsapp-bot-${o.slug}-2026.html" style="color:#22d3ee;">WhatsApp Bot for ${o.plural}</a></li>`).join('\n            ');

        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>${ind.metric}</p>

        <p>A WhatsApp chatbot does not replace you. It handles the repetitive stuff (pricing questions, scheduling, basic enquiries) so you can focus on the work that actually requires your skills. It answers instantly when you cannot. It works while you sleep. And it costs less than a single missed job.</p>

        <p>For ${ind.plural.toLowerCase()} who want customers to reach them easily without hiring extra staff, this is the simplest way to do it in 2026.</p>

        <h2>Why ${city.name} Small Businesses Need WhatsApp Automation</h2>

        <p>${city.name} has a population of ${city.population}. ${city.biz} Competition for customers is fierce, and response time often determines who gets the sale.</p>

        <p>When someone messages your business on WhatsApp asking about pricing, availability, or bookings, they expect a fast reply. If you are busy with a customer, on a job, or it is after hours, that message sits unanswered. The customer messages your competitor instead.</p>

        <p>A WhatsApp chatbot answers every message instantly. Not a generic "we will get back to you" auto-reply. An AI-powered bot that knows your business, your services, your prices, and your availability. It handles the conversation the same way you would, except it never sleeps and never puts anyone on hold.</p>

        <h2>Real Example: How a ${city.name} Business Uses It</h2>

        <p>Imagine you run a salon in ${city.name}. It is 9pm and someone messages asking if you have availability for a haircut tomorrow. Without a bot, that message sits until you check your phone in the morning. By then, they have booked with someone else.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Customer (9:14pm):</strong> Hi, do you have any slots tomorrow for a cut and blow dry?<br><br>
            <strong>Bot (9:14pm):</strong> Hey! Yes, I have openings at 10am, 1pm, and 3:30pm tomorrow. A cut and blow dry is ${currency === '£' ? '£35' : '$40'}. Which time works for you?<br><br>
            <strong>Customer:</strong> 1pm please<br><br>
            <strong>Bot:</strong> Booked! Cut and blow dry tomorrow at 1pm. I will send you a reminder in the morning. See you then!
        </blockquote>

        <p>The customer booked in under a minute. You woke up to a confirmed appointment in your calendar. That is the difference a WhatsApp bot makes.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>Will customers know they are talking to a bot?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, the bot identifies itself as an AI assistant. Transparency builds trust. Most customers prefer a fast, accurate bot response over waiting hours for a human reply.</p>

        <p><strong>What if a customer asks something the bot cannot answer?</strong></p>
        <p>The bot tells the customer that a team member will follow up and sends you a notification. You only step in for conversations that genuinely need a human.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I use my existing WhatsApp Business number?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes. You connect your existing WhatsApp Business number by scanning a QR code. No need to change your number or create a new one.</p>

        <p><strong>Is this different from the WhatsApp Business auto-reply?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, very different. WhatsApp's built-in auto-reply sends one fixed message. An AI chatbot carries out full conversations, answers specific questions, and handles bookings. It is the difference between a voicemail greeting and an actual receptionist.</p>
