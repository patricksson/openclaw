### /morning — 2026-05-02 11:40 UTC (FIRST RUN ON HETZNER — migration day)

**Migration context:** New VM `automatyn-prod` on Hetzner cx33 (Falkenstein), created 2026-05-01 22:49 UTC. Previously on GCE. Hetzner snapshot taken, daily backups enabled, delete+rebuild protection on. PM2 saas-api crash loop fixed (was fighting systemd `automatyn-api.service` for port 3001). Several migration-related env/auth issues uncovered — see Failures.

**Bot health:** automatyn-api ✅ active · openclaw-gateway ✅ active · 6 plugins · whatsapp:biz-7dbb13 paired (Pat) ✅ · whatsapp:biz-30adff (Adam @ AB Plumbing) still unpaired ❌ — email already sent, awaiting Adam.

**Triggers:** Skill's 3 trigger IDs (Content Machine / Medium Writer / Blog Writer) all return 404 — superseded by `trig_0181Shnfp8365bssX5RUSykv` "SEO Daily" (cron `0 10 * * *`, ✅ enabled, fired this morning at 10:00 UTC, site last-modified 10:16 UTC). Re-enabled `trig_01WpmgSA1ekBuyC7KS4RudCg` "SEO Audit weekly" (was disabled).

**X status:** @patrickssons reinstated ✅ — 118 followers (-2 vs yesterday's 120, +13 posts to 605). Last 10 posts: 165 impressions, 5 likes, 2 replies. Quality mode warranted.

**X drafts → Telegram:** 4 sent to @automatyntweetbot.
- 3 originals from morning pool (151c, 129c, 136c)
- 1 reply to @shawnchauhan1 (Meta capex post, age 0.2h, 145c)
- API budget: 10/900 reads ($0.05 of $4.50)
- Browser-use scrape: 35 handles scanned, only 1 candidate kept (@OpenAIDevs age 17.4h — rejected by recency rule, not drafted)
- **You approved 2 drafts within 30s of receipt** (original 1 posted 11:36, reply to @shawnchauhan1 posted 11:37)

**Reddit n8n:** webhook fired ✅ (`reddit-image-pipeline`)

**Outreach:**
- Reply detector: SKIPPED — Gmail OAuth `invalid_grant` (refresh token rejected, same as yesterday)
- Lead pool: 188 with_email · 182 E1 sent · 110 E2 sent (+7 today, batch 1 ongoing) · 88 E3 sent · 7 unsubscribed · **0 replied tracked** (likely false 0 — reply detector dead)
- Brevo opens fetched: 47 events, 29 matched. E1 opens 33→34, E2 17→23, E3 12→15.
- **Variant diagnostic: every pair shows 0% reply across 14d, 25 sends.** Most pairs flagged FULL RESET; S1×C1_binary, S2×C2_reverse, S3×C1_binary flagged FIX CTA. Could also be artifact of broken reply detection.
- E1-ready=6, E2-ready=39, E3-ready=15. Ingest blocked (Google Places API key has IP allowlist, doesn't include Hetzner IPs)
- **Sends planned (staggered, shortened sleeps because we're 4h late):**
  - Batch 1: E2 × 15 ✅ in progress (started 11:31)
  - Batch 2: E2 × 15 (after batch 1)
  - Batch 3: E1 × 25 — **SKIPPED** (E1 pool only 6, ingest broken)
  - Batch 4: E3 × 20

**SEO:** GSC fetch FAILED (invalid_grant). Live site checks: blog index 24 posts ✅, sitemap 116 URLs ✅, `/locations/` 404 ❌ (SEO Daily Task A "build 150 location pages" hasn't completed or wasn't synced).

**Signups overnight (last 14h):** 1 — `audittest+x@example.com` (test acct, unverified). No real signups.
**Cap-hit:** 0 real customers (only test-race from Apr 21).

**Skipped (with reason):**
- TikTok carousels (Step 4): POSTIZ_API_KEY in `.env` not in systemd, plus high blast radius — defer
- TikTok stats (Step 5): yt-dlp not installed
- LinkedIn (Step 6): same env gap
- Dev.to / Medium (Step 7-8): same blast-radius judgement, also covered by SEO Daily distribution
- git commit/push (Step 10): `~/openclaw` is **not a git repo** on this VM — site/blog now lives in github.com/automatyn/automatyn.github.io and is updated by SEO Daily directly

### Failures requiring user action (migration aftermath)

1. **Gmail OAuth refresh token (`invalid_grant`)** — used by reply detector + GSC fetch. Both broken. Need re-consent flow on a browser. Files: `saas-api/secrets/{gmail,gsc}-token.json`.
2. **Google Places API key IP allowlist** — current key blocks Hetzner IPv6 (`2a01:4f8:c014:a280::1`). Update allowlist in GCP console or remove restriction. Without this, `outreach/ingest.js` cannot refill the E1 pool.
3. **Hetzner API token leaked in chat** — rotate `5v9R...eR6` in Hetzner console.
4. **Production secrets plaintext in `/etc/systemd/system/automatyn-api.service`** (Brevo/OpenAI/Paddle/Dodo/Gmail/JWT). Move to `EnvironmentFile=/etc/automatyn-api.env` mode 600.
5. **Repo not local** — `~/openclaw` has no `.git`. Decide whether to clone/symlink the github.com/automatyn/automatyn.github.io repo here for local committing, or leave content management to the SEO Daily cloud trigger.
6. **POSTIZ_API_KEY** — present in `~/openclaw/.env` but not in systemd env, so systemd-managed services that need Postiz can't see it. Consolidate.
7. **Adam @ AB Plumbing WhatsApp** — provider never started server-side (`[whatsapp:biz-30adff]` absent from gateway journal). Email sent, awaiting his retry.

- X mentions: 5 fetched via API, all >48h (out of <6h recency window). 3 original X draft candidates pushed to Telegram gate (175/172/181 chars).
- Reply detector: **now fully working**. Scanned 10 inbox msgs, 0 replies matched — confirms zero-reply rate is real, not a detection bug.
- Outreach: E1 batch started in background (30 sends, variant-tracked — **first ever variant rotation batch**). Daily-report.js diagnosed 48 prior unlabelled sends as FIX CTA.
- SEO (GSC 7d): 277 imp / 0 clicks / avg pos 60.4. Chatbot-pricing cluster surging.
- Signups last 24h: 0 new (18 real + 1 test total).

- TikTok: deferred (Postiz analytics 500).
- Triggers: 5 total. 2 enabled (SEO Daily + SEO Day-14).

- X: 112f / 499t (+1 since morning). Analytics unchanged (2.6K imp, 10 verified, 4 replies). **Quality mode stays engaged.**
- X mentions: all >48h, none eligible. Live searches surfaced mostly competitor self-pitches (CallHolaAI, DobleAI, polsia, Nexora).
- X drafts pushed to Telegram gate (2): reply to @eviefoxiee (6.7k, 6h, SMB loneliness — 140 chars), reply to @polsia (13.4k, 4h, agent vs quiet framing — 144 chars). Skipped @Kaizen_CFO (11f, below floor).
- Volume note: Pat asked for 20 replies/day. Flagged as blocked by (a) <6h recency + quality-mode caps supply, (b) X API budget 500/mo = 17/day ceiling. Sustainable max right now is ~12 replies/day across 3 slots. Need recency relaxation or budget bump to hit 20.
- Reddit pipeline: webhook fired OK.
- Outreach: E1 30/30 daily cap already spent this morning. E2/E3 queues empty (earliest E1 was 2026-04-22, E2 eligible 2026-04-25). Pool 584 total / 161 with_email / 147 personalised / 78 E1 lifetime / 11 opens / 0 replies / 3 unsubs.

- Reddit pipeline: webhook fired OK.
- **Outreach FULL DAY 2026-04-24:** E1 sent **30** (daily cap), E2 0 (no Day-3 leads yet), E3 0. Opens **5** of today's batch (16.7%), 0 replies, 0 unsubs, 0 bounces. Reply detector scanned 35 inbox msgs — confirmed zero replies is real.
- **Outreach LIFETIME:** 82 E1 sent / 16 opens (~19.5%) / 0 replies / 3 unsubs / 0 bounces. Diagnosis stands: **FIX CTA**. First variant-tracked batch (today's 30) will yield first per-pair signal in 14d window.
- Evening sweep: e1 sender running in background (additional 15 — server day rolled to 2026-04-25 UTC mid-routine, so cap reset; 4 sent so far at log time). E2/E3 queues empty until 2026-04-25 wall-day.
- Brevo open fetch: 11 events matched to leads (48h window).
- Signups: 0 today (16 total agents — 14 free, 2 starter).
- Blog: **DID NOT publish today.** SEO Daily trigger (cron 0 10 * * *) already fired at 10:00 UTC but no blog/ commits exist in today's git log. Silent failure, needs investigation tomorrow.
- TikTok: 22 videos / ~6148 views / 76 likes (+11 since morning). No carousels generated this slot.
- LinkedIn / Dev.to / Medium: deferred all day (SEO Daily trigger was supposed to handle distribution; failed).

- **Variant diagnostic (14d):** All 12 (subject × CTA) pairs at INSUFFICIENT DATA (each has <10 sends; need more volume per pair before signal). Aggregate diagnosis FULL RESET (low open + low reply on overall) but that's distorted by the 48 unlabelled pre-variant baseline. CTA leaderboard: C4_link 19 sends 26.3% open, C2_reverse 13 sends 15.4%, C3/C1 ~11%. C4_link is winning opens but needs more sends to confirm reply behaviour.
- SEO (GSC 7d): top page /blog/how-much-does-ai-chatbot-cost-2026.html — **242 impressions / 0 clicks / pos 81.1**. Big chatbot-pricing keyword surge (15+ unique queries hitting that page). Position 81 = page 8 — needs CTR optimisation + on-page tune. No quick-wins at pos 8-15 yet. Homepage stable pos 3.3. /blog/passive-income-ai-agents-2026.html dropped to 11 imp (was top page, now decaying).
